The REXUS/BEXUS programme is realised under a bilateral Agency Agreement
between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space
Board (SNSB). The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to
students from other European countries through a collaboration with the
European Space Agency (ESA). EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the
Esrange Space Center of SSC and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR,
is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch
vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM and ESA provide technical support to
the student teams throughout the project. REXUS and BEXUS are launched from
SSC, Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden.
