The REXUS/BEXUS programme is realised under a bilateral Agency Agreement
between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space
Board (SNSB). The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to
students from other European countries through a collaboration with the
European Space Agency (ESA). EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the
Esrange Space Center of SSC and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR,
is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch
vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM and ESA provide technical support to
the student teams throughout the project. REXUS and BEXUS are launched from
SSC, Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden.

## The project background

To measure trace gases in the artic atmospheres have it challenges. Conventional High altitud 
sampling methods, such as Aircore, are expensive and requires support facilites near the 
landing area so the collected gases do not have time to mix which would lead to dimished 
scientific return.

The primary objective of the experiment consists of validating the proposed sampling system as
a reliable mechanism that enables sampling of stratospheric greenhouse gases in remote areas.
Achieving this objective consists in developing a cost-effective and re-usable stratospheric air
sampling system (i.e. AAC). Samples collected by the proposed mechanism are to be compared
against samples collected by a proven sampling system (i.e. CAC). The proven sampling system
is to be part of the experimental payload as a reference that will validate the proof-of-concept
air sampling system.
